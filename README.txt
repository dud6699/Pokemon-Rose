---Pokemon Rose Release Notes---

Version 1.3.2

Credits to Pokemon for music/sprites and Another Eden for music

NOTES:

To Update: copy all .txt files from the old save_files folder to the new one.

Double-click pokemon.exe to run

Default Controls:

Movement - Arrow Keys
Z - Continue/Select
X - Go back/Cancel 
C - Menu
V - Register Key

Various moves/abilities don't yet work fully.
(If a move doesn't do anything/is missing a side effect it probably isn't in the game yet, but
if if does something unintended it is probably a bug)

Story ends a little after the fifth leader.

There is a txt files named Default Settings.txt If you want to reset to the default settings, 
rename it to Sett!ngs.txt, otherwise you can leave it or delete it.

Pokemon with a pokedex number greater than or equal to 900 don't have their Pokedex numbers
set yet.

Some moves, namely ones that are only effective in doubles are removed.

For best gameplay experience, avoid modifying the save files.

INFO:

Most pokemon/items/moves are the gen VII versions but there are slight modifications
for certain pokemon (mostly starters)(ekans/arbok learns poison fang).

Pokemon that evolve by trading evolve either by an item (ex: Scizor and Metal Coat) or by 
level, with potentially other conditions. (ex: Shelmet and Karrablast) Most of these will be
noted in some way in the game.

KNOWN BUGS:

if you die to stealth rock, you will go a turn with a dead pokemon

water/volt absorb with multistrike moves procs multiple times

Some move names go outside the box

Potential bug with boss fight in route 3 and maractus using spiky shield

continuous moves like uproar, rollout don't move with enemy pokemon
